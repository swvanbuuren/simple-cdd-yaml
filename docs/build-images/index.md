# Build images

While this documenation is mostly about Simple-CDD-YAML, this section also
provides some advices for building and testing images with Simple-CDD from the
profiles that simple-CDD-YAML created.

This includes building [standard Simple-CDD images inside a docker
container](build-in-docker.md) (these include the Debian installer) and [testing
them with Qemu](test-on-qemu-with-uefi.md).  
It also includes the creation of ready-to-go [images built with
Debos](build-with-debos.md) (without the installer), that can be used for
quickly testing the image's functionality e.g. in a VM.
