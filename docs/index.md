# Simple-CDD-YAML

Welcome to the documentation of
[Simple-CDD-YAML](https://github.com/swvanbuuren/simple-cdd-yaml)!

Simple-CDD-YAML is a preprocesser for
[Simple-CDD](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/simple-cdd) using `YAML` recipe
files, as inspired by [debos](https://github.com/go-debos/debos).

Have a look at the [introduction](introduction.md) to get a quick idea of what
Simple-CDD-YAML is and what it can do.

To get going, follow the instructions in [getting started](getting_started.md).
Instructions for building and testing images are provided in the section [build
images](build-images/index.md)

The [examples](examples.md) page features a simple example of a `YAML` recipe.

Each `YAML` recipe consists of a series of actions, all of which are documented
under [actions](actions/index.md).

Refer to the [code reference](reference/index.md) to query actual source code
and see implementation details.
